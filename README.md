Berko's Game Of LIfe
================

Conway's Game of life -- Created by Berko (me!).

I learned a lot of valuable lessons while creating this:
  - Power of arrays and temporary arrays
  - More pygame stuff! (mouse input, using images, pretty basic stuff)
  - The importance(!) of indentation in Python -- It'll leave you debugging for hours
