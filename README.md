Berko's Game Of LIfe
================

Conway's Game of life -- Created by Berko (me!).

I learned a lot of valuable lessons while creating this:
  - Power of arrays and temporary arrays
  - More pygame stuff! (mouse input, using images, pretty basic stuff)
  - The importance(!) of indentation in Python -- It'll leave you debugging for hours
  - I've been reading "A New Kind of Science" By Stephen Wolfram which gives an introduction to cellular automata (which Conway's Game of Life is an example of) -- I hope to dive further into the visualization of cellular automata to produce more interesting/unique visualizations
  - Don't underestimate the power of music
